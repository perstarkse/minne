<h1>Get Started with Minne</h1>
<p>Minne offers two installation options to suit your needs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Hosted Version:</strong> Enjoy a hassle‐free experience by signing up for the ready‐to‐use service.
    Simply navigate to <code>/signup</code> to create an account.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-Hosted:</strong> Gain full control by running Minne on your own infrastructure. Visit
    <a href="https://github.com/perstarkse/minne">GitHub</a> to download the latest release. After extracting the
    release, open the <code>config.yaml</code> file and set the following configurations:
  </li>
</ol>
<pre class="overflow-x-auto text-sm">
  <code class="break-words whitespace-pre-wrap">
    OPENAI_API_KEY: your_api_key
    SMTP_EMAIL_RELAYER: your_email_relayer
    SMTP_USERNAME: your_smtp_username
    SMTP_PASSWORD: your_smtp_password
    DB_ADDRESS: your_db_address
    DB_USER: your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD: your_db_password
  </code>
</pre>
<p>The database settings relate to a running instance of SurrealDB. You can opt for their cloud solution or run your
  own instance.</p>

<p>Once your configuration is complete, start both the server and the worker. They can be hosted on separate
  machines, with different resource requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Server:</strong> Lightweight. A minimum of 1 core and 256MB of RAM is recommended.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Worker:</strong> Handles content parsing and creation of database entities. It's recommended to allocate at
    least two cores and 1024 MB RAM. It will run on less but might run into constraints depending on the content being
    parsed.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After launching the services, navigate to <code>&lt;your_url&gt;:3000/signup</code> to register. The first
  account created will automatically receive admin permissions, allowing you to later disable further registrations
  via the <code>/admin</code> page if desired.</p>

<p>From the homepage (<code>/</code>), you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit content, including files, videos, and URLs for ingestion.</li>
  <li>Monitor job statuses and manage your existing content.</li>
  <li>Search your content or start a chat conversation for assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visit the <code>/knowledge</code> page to view your content organized by different sections. This page also
  provides a visual demonstration of the graph database structure, enhancing your understanding of content
  relationships.</p>

<p>This streamlined setup ensures intuitive onboarding while offering robust customization options. Whether you are
  a novice or an advanced user, Minne is designed to deliver a smooth experience and reliable performance.</p>
