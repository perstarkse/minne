<h1>Mobile Friendly Ingression: How to Submit Content from iOS to Minne</h1>
<p>Minne is built with simplicity in mind. Whether you wish to save a file, capture a thought, or share a page,
  submitting content is effortless. Our server provides API access that enables users to perform actions using a
  personalized API key.</p>

<p>An iOS shortcut has been developed to streamline the process of sending content. To begin, navigate to
  <code>/account</code> and generate an API key. Once created, you will see an option to download the iOS shortcut.
</p>

<p>After downloading the shortcut, update the "Get response from URL" authentication headers with your API key. If
  you are self-hosting, ensure the URL is adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>The shortcut integrates seamlessly with iOS. When you "share with Minne," you will be prompted to provide
  instructions to the AI and to either choose an existing category or create a new one for your submission.</p>

<p>While an Android solution is in the works, for now you can add the web app to your home screen as a Progressive
  Web App (PWA) for a similar mobile-friendly experience.</p>
