## The "Why" Behind Minne

Personal knowledge management has always fascinated me. I wanted something that made it incredibly easy to capture content—snippets of text, URLs, media—while automatically discovering connections between ideas. But I also wanted control over my knowledge structure.

Traditional tools like Logseq and Obsidian are excellent, but manual linking often becomes a hindrance. Fully automated systems sometimes miss important context or create relationships I wouldn't have chosen.

Minne offers the best of both worlds: effortless capture with AI-assisted relationship discovery, but with flexibility to manually curate, edit, or override connections. Let AI handle the heavy lifting, take full control yourself, or use a hybrid approach where AI suggests and you approve.

## Design Principles

- **Capture should be instant** — No friction between thought and storage
- **Connections should emerge** — AI finds relationships you might miss
- **Control should be optional** — Automate by default, curate when it matters
- **Privacy should be default** — Self-hosted, your data stays yours

## Roadmap

### Near-term

- [ ] TUI frontend with system editor integration
- [ ] Enhanced retrieval recall via improved reranking
- [ ] Additional content type support (e-books, research papers)

### Medium-term

- [ ] Embedded SurrealDB option (zero-config `nix run` with just `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Browser extension for seamless capture
- [ ] Mobile-native apps

### Long-term

- [ ] Federated knowledge sharing (opt-in)
- [ ] Local LLM integration (fully offline operation)
- [ ] Plugin system for custom entity extractors
